            Welcome to my portfolio! I am Aparna v v, a passionate front-end developer who loves turning ideas into beautiful and functional websites. I enjoy working with modern tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to create smooth, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. I’m always learning new technologies and improving my skills because I believe great design comes from creativity and continuous growth.
As a fresher, I am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects and contribute to a team where I can learn, grow, and deliver meaningful results.
